package uuid

// Random returns a Random (Version 4) UUID or panics.
//
// The strength of the UUIDs is based on the strength of the crypto/rand
// package.
//
// A note about uniqueness derived from from the UUID Wikipedia entry:
//
//  Randomly generated UUIDs have 122 random bits.  One's annual risk of being
//  hit by a meteorite is estimated to be one chance in 17 billion, that
//  means the probability is about 0.00000000006 (6 × 10−11),
//  equivalent to the odds of creating a few tens of trillions of UUIDs in a
//  year and having one duplicate.
