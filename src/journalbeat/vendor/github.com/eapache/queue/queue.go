Package queue provides a fast, ring-buffer queue based on the version suggested by Dariusz GÃ³recki.
Using this instead of other, simpler, queue implementations (slice+append or linked list) provides
substantial memory and time benefits, and fewer GC pauses.

The queue implemented here is as fast as it is for an additional reason: it is *not* thread-safe.
